=== SPACE VALET
Billionaires have colonized, commercialized and privatized the moon. Your only shot at getting to go up there is to work your same crappy job as a valet, but _in space_, which is much cooler. It'll be worth it. Definitely.

=== GAMEPLAY
- You are a character running around on the moon
- You can enter and exit spacecraft and fly them around in 2D above the ground (can't go upwards), they are basically 'space cars'
- Spacecraft have a health meter which goes down if you crash them into the environment or other vehicles
- NPCs arrive in a spacecraft and wait for you to come and take the keys, then go into a building
- You need to find a place to park the spacecraft without damaging it, so that more guests can arrive
- Guests also start exiting the building after a while, and will request their vehicle back
- You need to retrieve the right vehicle and drive it back to them, if correct they will drive off

=== TODO
- Spacecraft enter/drive/exit, probably want a few different feel configurations for different vehicles
- Spacecraft animations (tilt to turn/thrust/brake)
	- need vertical collisions when below walls so you can't climb them
	- need to smooth rotation somehow when one anchor is off the cliff
	- confirm rotation speed isn't affected by slope angle
	- introduce additional roll based on sideways slope angle
- Inverted hull outline so you know which spacecraft you're interacting with, always wanted to try this
- NPC arrival/departure
- Spacecraft damage
- Particle effects
- Sound effects
- Music
- Main menu
