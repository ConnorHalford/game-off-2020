=== SPACE VALET
Billionaires have colonized, commercialized and privatized the moon. Your only shot at getting to go up there is to work your same crappy job as a valet, but _in space_, which is much cooler. It'll be worth it. Definitely.

=== GAMEPLAY
- You are a character running around on the moon
- You can enter and exit spacecraft and fly them around in 2D above the ground (can't go upwards), they are basically 'space cars'
- Spacecraft have a health meter which goes down if you crash them into the environment or other vehicles
- NPCs arrive in a spacecraft and wait for you to come and take the keys, then go into a building
- You need to find a place to park the spacecraft without damaging it, so that more guests can arrive
- Guests also start exiting the building after a while, and will request their vehicle back
- You need to retrieve the right vehicle and drive it back to them, if correct they will drive off

=== TODO
- NPC arrival/departure
- Spacecraft damage
- Particle effects
- Sound effects
- Music
- Main menu
- Maybe have different spacecraft have different handling

=== BUGS
- Holding a move input in mid-air towards a wall pins the player to that wall
- Fix spacecraft bobbing while player is standing on it
- Fix spacecraft freaking out when moving horizontally over ramps
- Some weirdness when jumping on vehicles on ramps
