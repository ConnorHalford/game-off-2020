=== RELEASE
- itch page + jam submission
- Update repo readme
- Make repo public
- Tweets
	- Links to itch and github
	- New things: 2D characters in 3D world, inverted hull outline (copy mesh, expand, reverse triangle winding to turn mesh inside out, tint black), Asset Forge, projectors
	- Successes: using rendertextures for custom 3D model previews in UI, raycast maths for spacecraft locomotion, some nice feel / polish (buffer jump inputs, spacecraft pitch and roll), enjoyed the process and didn't work too hard or too long
	- Simplifications: static camera, mostly static UI, uninteractive UI, kenney assets
	- Missing features: particle effects, sound effects, music
	- Bugs: {list}

=== BUGS
- Holding a move input in mid-air towards a wall pins the player to that wall
- Large invisible corners on environment collision
- Don't seem to be able to give equivalent craft for departures, has to be original instance
- Brief shadow flicker when new craft spawned, possibly to do with NPC character shadow projector?
- Spacecraft vibrates while player is standing on it
- Spacecraft pitch forward and backward rapidly when moving horizontally over ramps
- Sometimes a spacecraft can bump another spacecraft up into the air
- World-space arrivals/departures text doesn't receive shadows
