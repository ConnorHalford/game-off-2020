=== SPACE VALET
Billionaires have colonized, commercialized and privatized the moon. Your only shot at getting to go up there is to work your same crappy job as a valet, but _in space_, which is much cooler. It'll be worth it. Definitely.

=== GAMEPLAY
- You are a character running around on the moon
- You can enter and exit spacecraft and fly them around in 2D above the ground (can't go upwards), they are basically 'space cars'
- Spacecraft have a health meter which goes down if you crash them into the environment or other vehicles
- NPCs arrive in a spacecraft and wait for you to come and take the keys, then go into a building
- You need to find a place to park the spacecraft without damaging it, so that more guests can arrive
- Guests also start exiting the building after a while, and will request their vehicle back
- You need to retrieve the right vehicle and drive it back to them, if correct they will drive off

=== TODO
- Pool spacecraft, including initial population
- Spacecraft UI
	- Timer bar ticking down (no visible seconds count)
	- Arrival timer ticks down significantly more slowly than departure timer, so player can choose to let them wait and give themself breathing room
	- Set background color of craft notification to blend from green to red
- Gameplay loop
	- Upon entering an arriving or exiting a departing craft you get a tip based on how much of the timer was left
	- Central HUD shows shift timer and tips earned
	- Game ends when shift ends, tips earned is score, be nice to also show how many craft were valeted
- NPC arrival/departure
	- The tip you receive is based on how much of the timer is remaining
	- No lives, no game over, just get highest score possible in a single shift
	- Endless mode is just no shift timer

	- Upon entering NPC jumps offscreen and craft is added to list of potential departures (with minimum time before departure)
	- NPC stands next to spot, if correct vehicle is inside exit area, NPC jumps in, collision disabled, floats upward offscreen
		- Only one NPC is visible at front of arrival queue, but can have multiple NPCs waiting at departures so player can choose which order to serve them
	- Global timer represents your shift, goal is to valet as many craft as possible, so you control your own difficulty through the rate at which you accept arrivals

=== BUGS
- Large invisible corners on environment collision
- Holding a move input in mid-air towards a wall pins the player to that wall
- Fix spacecraft bobbing while player is standing on it
- Fix spacecraft freaking out when moving horizontally over ramps
- Some weirdness when jumping on vehicles on ramps
- World-space arrivals/departures text doesn't receive shadows
