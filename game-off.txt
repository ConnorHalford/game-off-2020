=== TODO
- Finish environment
- Gameplay loop
	- Upon entering an arriving or exiting a departing craft you get a tip based on how much of the timer was left
		- Spawn tip number that moves upwards and fades, place above spacecraft so you know which one gives what money
- Game balance
	- Time between new spawns
	- Time between arrival and departure
	- Duration of NPC arrival timer
	- Duration of NPC departure timer
	- To increase difficulty over time, reduce all of the above (global multiplier?)
	- Probably want NPC arrival duration much longer than NPC departure timer, so player can choose to let them wait and give themself breathing room to clear departures

- Sound effects
- Music

=== RELEASE

- Try web build
- Standalone build(s?)

=== BUGS
- Don't seem to be able to give equivalent craft for departures, has to be original instance
- Brief shadow flicker when new craft spawned, possibly to do with NPC character shadow projector?
- Departures fly off at an angle if the craft still has roll
- NPCs jump to where the craft was when they took it, not where it is (particularly noticeable if you dropoff at speed)
- Large invisible corners on environment collision
- Holding a move input in mid-air towards a wall pins the player to that wall
- Fix spacecraft bobbing while player is standing on it
- Fix spacecraft freaking out when moving horizontally over ramps
- Some weirdness when jumping on vehicles on ramps
- World-space arrivals/departures text doesn't receive shadows
