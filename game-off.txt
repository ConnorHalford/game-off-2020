=== SPACE VALET
Billionaires have colonized, commercialized and privatized the moon. Your only shot at getting to go up there is to work your same crappy job as a valet, but _in space_, which is much cooler. It'll be worth it. Definitely.

=== GAMEPLAY
- You are a character running around on the moon
- You can enter and exit spacecraft and fly them around in 2D above the ground (can't go upwards), they are basically 'space cars'
- Spacecraft have a health meter which goes down if you crash them into the environment or other vehicles
- NPCs arrive in a spacecraft and wait for you to come and take the keys, then go into a building
- You need to find a place to park the spacecraft without damaging it, so that more guests can arrive
- Guests also start exiting the building after a while, and will request their vehicle back
- You need to retrieve the right vehicle and drive it back to them, if correct they will drive off

=== TODO
- Pool spacecraft, including initial population
- Pool UI
- Spacecraft UI
	- Arrival timer ticks down significantly more slowly than departure timer, so player can choose to let them wait and give themself breathing room
- Gameplay loop
	- Upon entering an arriving or exiting a departing craft you get a tip based on how much of the timer was left
	- Central HUD shows shift timer and tips earned
	- Game ends when shift ends, tips earned is score, be nice to also show how many craft were valeted
- NPC arrival/departure
	- The tip you receive is based on how much of the timer is remaining
	- No lives, no game over, just get highest score possible in a single shift
	- Endless mode is just no shift timer

- Game balance
- Increase difficulty over time
- Spacecraft UI slide/fade in/out animations
- Main menu
- Particle effects
- Sound effects
- Music

=== BUGS
- Don't seem to be able to give equivalent craft for departures, has to be original instance
- Brief shadow flicker when new craft spawned, possibly to do with NPC character shadow projector?
- Departures fly off at an angle if the craft still has roll
- NPCs jump to where the craft was when they took it, not where it is (particularly noticeable if you dropoff at speed)
- Large invisible corners on environment collision
- Holding a move input in mid-air towards a wall pins the player to that wall
- Fix spacecraft bobbing while player is standing on it
- Fix spacecraft freaking out when moving horizontally over ramps
- Some weirdness when jumping on vehicles on ramps
- World-space arrivals/departures text doesn't receive shadows
