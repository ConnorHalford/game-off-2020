=== BUGS
- Holding a move input in mid-air towards a wall pins the player to that wall
- Large invisible corners on environment collision
- Don't seem to be able to give equivalent craft for departures, has to be original instance
- Brief shadow flicker when new craft spawned, possibly to do with NPC character shadow projector?
- Spacecraft vibrates while player is standing on it
- Spacecraft pitch forward and backward rapidly when moving horizontally over ramps
- Sometimes a spacecraft can bump another spacecraft up into the air
- World-space arrivals/departures text doesn't receive shadows
- UI departure animations can go wrong if the resolution of the game is changed at runtime, such as by entering/exiting fullscreen
- Restarting the game seems to not reset some spacecraft/NPCs correctly sometimes
